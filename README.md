# learning_stack
It's learning project. During development of this project I want
to learn how to work with FastAPI, SQAlchemy, Alembic and other
modules.

## Goal
Goal is simple. I want to understand basics of working with those
modules, write reliable and upgradable code.

## Principes
During this project I want to folow this principes:
 - Do not copy-paste AI or any other code. Do not use inline suggestions
 - Do not do any "temporary solutions". Write reliable code only
 - Write easy-to-read code
 - Follow project structure (code, services, endpoint etc). Write services like
 FastAPI never exists.
